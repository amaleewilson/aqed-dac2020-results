## Custon Dataflow design - bugfree version

The additional files for  Cadence Jaspergold are:

   1. _jasper.tcl_ : contains the tcl file that may be sourced to run BMC on the design.
   2. _dataflow.flist_ : contains the list of verilog files read by the formal tool
   3. _debug_cex.sig_ : contains a list of waveform that were used for debugging the bug.
                        Can be loaded into the _Cadence JasperGold_ waveform viewer.

To run with Cadence Jaspergold:

1) Launch the jaspergold GUI: "jaspergold"

2) In the command window, source the tcl file: "source jasper.tcl"

The design should exceed the bound for the counterexample in the design with
the bug (98 cycles).

### Assertions

The assertions to evaluate the Response Bound (RB) check can be found in
dataflow_stalls_kernel.v, lines 1386 and 1390.

It should be noted that an A-QED module was not added to this design, as the
bug was detected using the RB check and not Functional Consistency.
