# Directory Structure

1) src

This directory contains the C++ source code used to generate the verified RTL.
There are two sub-directories, one for the bugfree version of the design, and 
on containing the bug.

2) rtl

This directory contains the synthesized RTL, generated using Vivado HLS 2018.2.
There are two sub-directories, one for the bugfree version of the design, and
on containing the bug. Each contains a README, detailing the A-QED setup and
how to run it using Cadence Jaspergold.
