## Optical Flow example

This example uses the Optical Flow design from the Rosetta suite of High-Level
Synthesis benchmarks developed at Cornell University[1].

### Directory Structure

1) src

This directory contains the C++ source code used to generate the verified RTL.
There are two sub-directories:
    1. bugfree: the clean version of the design without the bug.
    2. withbug: a version of the desgn containing the bug.

Each also contains the synthesis directory, optical-flow, use to generate
the RTL with Vivado v2017.1.

#### Source Code Edits

   Edits made to  optial_flow.cpp are as follows (also in optical_flow.cpp.diff)
      1. The header file typedefs.h is included in the local directory  
      2. The max_width and default_depth is reduced to 10.
         (The full optical flow module proved too large for the BMC tool to handle)
      3. The pragmas for generating an axi interface were also removed.

2) rtl

This directory contains the synthesized RTL, generated using Vivado HLS 2018.2.
There are two sub-directories:
    1. bugfree: the clean version of the design without the bug.
    2. withbug: a version of the desgn containing the bug.

Each contains a README, detailing the A-QED setup and how to run it using 
Cadence Jaspergold.
